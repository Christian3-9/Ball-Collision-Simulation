# Ball Collision Simulation

This project is a dynamic ball collision simulation developed using OpenGL and Qt. It demonstrates real-time physics calculations and provides interactive controls for creating and customizing collisions.

## Features
- Real-time collision detection and response between multiple balls.
- Two modes:
  - Automatic mode: Balls are created dynamically and interact based on preset parameters.
  - Interactive mode: Users can customize ball sizes, velocities, and positions before creating them.
- Modular design with clean code principles for scalability.

## Prerequisites
- Qt 5 or later
- OpenGL libraries

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Christian3-9/Ball-Collision-Simulation.git
